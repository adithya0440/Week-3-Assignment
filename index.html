                        Three men set out on horseback on a snowy landscape from the Wall.
                        The young one sees smoke from a fire and creeps up on it. He sees bodies hacked to bits and heads on stakes, dismembered limbs all around, including women and children.
                        He turns and runs. We see their bodies are laid out in a kind of symbol, like a ring.
                        He is chastised by his leader for being a coward, and reminded of their mission and the punishment for desertion.
                        His comrades go to check out the bodies, and find theyve disappeared.<br><br>

                        One man finds what could be an organ in the snow, hes about to show it to the other man when something dark and sinister pops up out of snow and slashes him down. The remaining men run. Theyre chased by something that doesnt seem human.
                        The creature catches one of the men and slices off his head. The remaining man drops to his knees and awaits his fate.
                        Later, he stumbles across a field. Not dead. A band of men on horses intercept him.
                        In Winterfell, Ned Stark (Sean Bean) watches his son Bran practice archery with the aid of Jon Snow, Neds bastard son.
                        Inside the castle, his young daughter Arya practices needlepoint. Bran lets fly his arrow and misses wildly.<br><br>

                        Suddenly another strikes the bullseye. They turn to see who let it go its Arya, showing up her brother.
                        A man comes to report they captured a deserter from the Nights Watch. Neds wife Catelyn asks him if he has to do what must be done. Ned says yes, and 10 year old Bran is coming to watch.
                        They march the deserter to be beheaded. He tells Ned he saw White Walkers.
                        Bran watches as his father beheads the man. Jon commends Bran for not looking away.
                        After, Ned tells Bran that the White Walkers have been gone for thousands of years and the deserter must be crazy. He had to cut the man's head off himself because he passed the sentence, Ned explains.
                        On the ride home they come upon a disemboweled elk and wonder what could have done it.<br><br>

                        They find a similarly hacked up wolf nearby, with two young pups. They believe theyre rare kind of wolf, a direwolf, of which there are only five south of the wall. Ned commands them killed because they wont survive without their mother.
                        Jon suggests instead that the five pups go to the five Stark children. Jon gets the runt of the litter.
                        Kings Landing, Capital of the Seven Kingdoms A funeral takes place in the grand cathedral.
                        Ser Jaime Lannister checks on his twin sister, Queen Cersei Baratheon of the House of Lannister. Shes worried the dead guy Jon Arryn might have spilled her secret to her husband, the king.
                        Back in Winterfell Cat tells her husband the news of Jon Arryns death. He was like a father to Ned. King Robert of Baratheon and Queen Cersei are on the way to Winterfell with their entourage.
                        Bran climbs to the top of the compound to see the hundreds approaching. His mom chides him not to climb.<br><br>

                        The king and queen arrive. The Starks line up to greet them.
                        Prince Joffrey Baratheon of the House of Baratheon makes eyes at Sansa Stark, Neds young daughter. They greet each other warmly.
                        Arya is eager to see the imp.
                        King Robert asks Ned to take him to the crypt. Down there, Robert says Arryn got sick suddenly and died.
